Dry-wet waste segregator

ABSTRACT:

A Dry-wet waste segregator is a type of device that segregates dry and wet waste into separate bins. This project aims at developing a segregator that works by sensing the moisture of the waste by using IOT.  This project is an innovative way to revolutionize the waste management system using sensors. The improper disposal and management of waste have led to various environmental and health hazards. To address these issues, waste segregation has emerged as a crucial strategy in solid waste management. The economic value of waste is best realized when it is segregated. Currently there is no such system of segregation of dry and wet wastes at a household level. This project proposes an Automated Waste Segregator (AWS) which is a cheap, easy to use solution for a segregation system at households, so that it can be sent directly for processing. This project is designed to sort the refuse into wet waste and dry waste. We use the Arduino microprocessor to process the waste and segregate them into separate bins.
